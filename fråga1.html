<button class="accordion">How can I improve my dribbling skills effectively?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Consistent practice is key. Start with basic dribbling drills to build control and gradually incorporate advanced moves like crossovers, behind-the-back, and between-the-legs dribbles. Focus on maintaining a low dribble, keeping your head up, and using your fingertips to control the ball.</p>

<button class="accordion">What are some tips for developing a more accurate shot?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Focus on proper hand positioning, balance, and follow-through. Ensure your shooting hand is under the ball and your non-shooting hand guides it. Practice regularly from different spots on the court, and work on your footwork to improve consistency.

<button class="accordion">How can I finish better around the rim against taller defenders?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Use a variety of layups, including reverse and finger rolls, to keep defenders guessing. Practice finishing with both hands and develop a reliable hook shot. Improving your vertical leap and strength can also help you finish stronger at the basket.</p>
